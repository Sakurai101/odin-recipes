# Odin Recipes

A bare-bones recipe website built for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) foundations course.  
Basically my playground for beating HTML/CSS into submission while making something vaguely edible-looking.

## What I'm Crushing Here
- ✅ Cooking up some nasty HTML (lists, links, img tags - the whole microwave dinner)  
- ✅ Making it slightly less ugly with CSS (colors, margins, the works)  
- ✅ Not getting lost between pages (relative vs absolute paths showdown)  
- ✅ Pushing this bad boy to GitHub like a true code chef  

## Tech Stack
- HTML5 (the OG web skeleton)  
- CSS3 (because unstyled websites hurt my eyes)  
- Git/GitHub (for those "oops" moments)
